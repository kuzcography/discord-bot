## About the project

### Description

This repository brings together various Discord bots in the form of mini-projects. They are mainly created to handle various situations (pinging, answering commands, moderation, etc.) on Discord servers. This is mainly a personal project for learning purposes, not for deployment.

### Repository explanation

This repository is structured as a bot discord mini-project. You can see that each folder is a mini-project with a specific name.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

This project has several mini-projects so I invite you to see the prerequisites for each of them. However, here are the global prerequisites:
- **Rust** (1.56.0 or higher) - Install from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- **Cargo** - Comes with Rust installation.
- **A Discord Bot Token** - Create one via the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).


### Installation

I invite you to see how to install each mini-project correctly directly via their own README.md.

## Contact

### How to contact me
